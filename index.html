Subject: Backend Software Engineer Application - [Job Title] - [Company Name]

Dear [Mr./Ms./Mx. Last Name or Hiring Team],

I'm excited to apply for the Backend Software Engineer position at [Company Name], which I saw on [Platform where you found the job]. With 3.5 years of experience building scalable backend systems, especially with Go and JavaScript, I'm confident I'm a great fit for your team.

At Collabera Digital (client: Razorpay), I automated banking workflows, cutting manual effort by 60%, and boosted code coverage to over 80%. I also optimized Kafka-based systems for better scalability. My work at Vantage Systech included refactoring to Clean Architecture and contributing to a modular framework, showing my commitment to maintainable and efficient code.

My projects, like "Banking Automation" (Go, Kafka) and "RayzrSense" (JavaScript, Cohere.ai), highlight my ability to deliver real-world impact and solve complex problems.

I'm a collaborative and proactive engineer, ready to bring my Go and distributed systems expertise to your innovative projects. My remote work experience also makes me well-prepared for effective international collaboration.

Thanks for considering my application. My resume is attached, and I'd love to chat more about how I can contribute to [Company Name]!

Sincerely,
Satyam Singh
